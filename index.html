        <h3>Not a dessert.</h3>
        <p>This is a Raspberry Pi. And as delicious as it sounds, you definitely do not want to eat one of these bad boys.</p>
        <div class="content">
            <p>A Raspberry Pi is actually a single-board, miniature computer. Most models are roughly the size of a large credit card.
                It comes in 5 different models (as of now). The one pictured above is a model 4, and it is (currently) the newest model.
                There are also the 1,2,3, and the zero. The model 4's ports include (from top right to bottom left):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>An 1 Gigabit ethernet port</li>
                <li>2 USB 3.0 ports</li>
                <li>2 USB 2.0 ports</li>
                <li>A 3.5mm audio out port</li>
                <li>A 40-pin ribbon camera connector</li>
                <li>2 mini-HDMI ports (the Pi 4B is capable of running two 4K displays simultaneously)</li>
                <li>A USB Type-C power port</li>
                <li>A 40-Pin ribbon display connector</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition, it also has:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>On board Bluetooth 5.0 and Wi-Fi</li>
                <li>A Broadcom BCM2711 Quad core 64-bit SoC</li>
                <li>A 40 pin GPIO header</li>
                <li>Much more!</li>
            </ul>

        <p>What are the practical uses of a Raspberry Pi?</p>
        <img class="home-piintro-img" src="pictures/home-bgimg.png">
        <h3>Sky's the limit.</h3>
        <p>The things you can do with a Raspberry Pi are endless. For example, you can use it to make a security system, like Nest or Arlo,
            or to make a home assistant, like Alexa or Google Home, or for home automation, like ZWave.
