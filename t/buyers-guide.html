            <h1>Introduction</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            In this post, I'll explain about the different types of Raspberry Pis and which one suits you and your project. We'll also talk about starter kits 
            and if they're worth it. The first step is to <span style="font-weight: bold;">have a project in mind</span>.
            Knowing what you want to make is crucial to deciding which Pi to buy.

            <h1>The Budget Buy: Raspberry Pi Zero W</h1>
        </div>
        <h4><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/">Raspberry Pi Zero W</a></h4>
        <p>
            Money doesn't grow on trees. If you're looking for a cheaper Pi, my best pick is the Raspberry Pi Zero W. Emphasis on the 'W'. The 'W' means it has onboard Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, which may not seem like
            a huge deal, but the Raspberry Pi Zero doesn't have an ethernet port, which means you'd have to buy a separate USB Wi-Fi dongle, which now takes up your only USB port. So no keyboard/mouse.
            The Raspberry Pi Zero W is a much smaller, more watered down Pi. It's good for simple or small projects. But beware, there are cutbacks. The most noticable one is RAM. The Raspberry Pi Zero W only comes 
            with 512MB of RAM, a very small amount compared to other Pis' 1, 2, and 4GB of RAM. This essentially means it won't be nearly as fast as a more expensive Pi. It also doesn't come with GPIO pins, which are
            extremely necessary if you want to connect anything to the Pi (sensors, buzzers, etc.) Instead, they must be bought separately and soldered on. If you're like me and have no soldering experience, don't panic. 
            You can buy a Raspberry Pi Zero WH, which comes with pre-soldered pins.

        </div>
        <h3>Pros</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Small - Can fit in small projects that are limited by space</li>
            <li>Cheap - Availiable for as low as $10</li>
            <li>Wi-Fi - No ethernet or Wi-Fi dongle needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Low RAM - Isn't very fast</li>
            <li>No GPIO Pins - Soldering experience required, or you can buy a Zero WH, which comes whit Pins</li>
            <li>Only 1 micro USB port - You'll need a converter to regular USB, and a Keyboard and Mouse that connect to the same dongle</li>
        </ul>

            <h1>The Flagship Buy: Raspberry Pi 4</h1>
        </div>
        <h4><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 4</a></h4>
        <p>
            My personal favorite, the Raspberry Pi 4 is the newest (as of now) Raspberry Pi. It comes loaded with 4 USB Ports,
            a gigabit ethernet port, dual 4K Monitor Support, on-board Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and up to 4GB of RAM. This Pi is powerful enough to be
            your desktop computer, while still maintaining a 40-Pin GPIO header that allows you to connect sensors, buzzers and other great
            gadgets. The board costs about $35, which is still cheap and an awesome steal for someone who uses their computer casually. Obviously,
            it's not going to be able to run graphic-intense games, but if you're someone who just browses the internet and needs their computer for
            its basic functions, this might be the perfect desktop replacement for you.

            <img class="post-img" src="../pictures/post-pictures/pi4-diagram-empty.png" />
        </div>
        <h3>Pros</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Full Functionality - 4 USB ports and dual 4k monitor support is about as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>No extra work - No soldering; GPIO pins are already included</li>
            <li>Powerful - 4GB of RAM allows it to be a great desktop replacement</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Expensive - The 1GB version already sets you back $35</li>
            <li>Larger - It's not huge, but it's bigger than the Zero.</li>
        </ul>

            <h1>The Value Buy: Vilros Raspberry Pi 4 Basic Kit</h1>
        </div>
        <h4><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vilros-Raspberry-Basic-Cooled-Case/dp/B07TKFFCF1/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2NQZ5IJ6HM5QW&dchild=1&keywords=vilros%2Braspberry%2Bpi%2B4&qid=1589846120&sprefix=vilros%2B%2Caps%2C408&sr=8-5&th=1">Vilros Raspberry Pi 4 Basic Kit</a></h4>
        <p>
            Let's talk about starter kits. Are they worth it? It depends what they have in them. A good starter kit will have a case, a power supply
            with a switch, and some sort of cooling mechanism. A case is important if your Pi is going to be used in a project where it isn't just
            going to be sitting on your desk. A power supply with a switch is important to be able to reboot your Pi. You're going to be rebooting your
            pi a lot, especially if you're running it headless (without a monitor and keyboard/mouse). You don't want to have to unplug it every time, and
            the switch will make your life so much easier. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it needs to have a cooling mechanism. A fan will be the most
            effective, but heat sinks are okay too because they don't make any noise. Here's the thing. Your Pi is going to get hot when its doing anything that
            is using an internet connection or is graphics-intense. My model 4's CPU temperature reaches up to 45 degrees celsius, even with a fan. The Vilros
            Raspberry Pi 4 Basic Kit has all of the above and is an absolute steal for $60-85.

        </div>
        <p>
            Finally it's time to decide what kind of Pi is right for you. If you're looking for an easy setup and don't mind a slightly higher
            price, one of the starter kits might be for you. If you know what you're doing and want to buy the parts separately, go with just the
            board. If you're looking for a cheaper, smaller model (and don't mind some soldering), maybe you go with the Zero W or Zero WH. If you're
            looking for the best, go for the 4. Just remember, in the end, its your decision.
